# ðŸš€ HPC: Introduction to LLMs Workshop Overview ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **HPC: Introduction to LLMs Workshop**! ðŸŽ‰  
This workshop provides easy-to-understand resources and hands-on tutorials on how **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** is applied to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** ðŸ¤–. Designed for both **STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)** and **non-STEM** majors, the content is beginner-friendly, with no prior technical background required.

## Workshop Objective ðŸŽ¯

Our goal is to bridge the gap between **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Through this workshop, you'll explore how LLMs leverage the power of HPC for advanced computations and how these models are transforming industries like AI, healthcare, and more.
